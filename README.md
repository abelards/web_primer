# Web Architecture Primer
Follow the journey of a web request, from your click to your reading the content you asked for.

## HOWTO use it
* hover on a word to get a short definition
* hover over a number to see what happens at this step
* on mobile, touching instead of clicking ;)

## TODO
* use pretty icons
* get people's feedback on the idea and texts
* use JS Plumb

## Why?
Our lives increasingly depends on computers and networks ; especially the Internet and web applications.

Having a basic understanding how they work should be part of today's education, a skill as important as writing or counting.

But it's easy to get lost with all those words, so I made an interactive schema of the "Big Picture".


## How?
I made this list of keywords and tracing of a request's journey so people can have a visual understanding.

It's interactive if viewed in a browser or tablet, less so on a phone, but can still be used as a quick reference.


## You can help!
I'm bad with design and colors, so you can help making this more attractive.

My explanations may require some more rephrasing to be either exhaustive or concise.

You are invited to fork this project and mess with it as much as you want, please feel free!
